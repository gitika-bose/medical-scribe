# Install Firebase SDK

Due to PowerShell execution policy, please run this command manually:

## Option 1: Use CMD
Open Command Prompt (not PowerShell) and run:
```cmd
cd frontend
npm install firebase
```

## Option 2: Use PowerShell with bypass
```powershell
cd frontend
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command "npm install firebase"
```

## Option 3: Use VS Code Terminal
1. Open VS Code terminal
2. Make sure you're in the frontend directory
3. Run: `npm install firebase`

After installation completes, let me know and I'll continue with the Firebase setup!
