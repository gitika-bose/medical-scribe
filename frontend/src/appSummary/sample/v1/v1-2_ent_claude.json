    "summary": "Patient consulted for deviated septum and nasal congestion. Doctor explained the anatomy of the nasal septum and turbinates, and how a deviated septum causes fixed obstruction while turbinate swelling causes variable obstruction. Patient has deviation on the left side in the front and lower part. Doctor recommended trying saline spray followed by Flonase twice daily to control turbinate swelling, then adding nasal strips to evaluate effectiveness before considering surgery. Weight was noted as a factor affecting snoring through throat obstruction. Follow-up scheduled after trial period of treatments.",
