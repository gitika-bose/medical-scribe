The tears are generally not repairable and appear crab-like in pattern. However, doctor noted that sometimes upon arthroscopy, tears may be found to be repairable."

            "description": "Arthroscopy involves making three small incisions in the knee. The procedure will remove the torn portion of the meniscus and reshape it to normal appearance while preserving as much healthy meniscus tissue as possible. If tissue is found to be repairable during surgery, doctor will opt for repair instead. Repair would require crutches and brace for 6 weeks when out of bed. If excision only, can walk immediately with no crutches needed. Recovery takes 4-6 weeks. 90% chance of substantial improvement, 1% chance of making it worse. Risks include infection, blood clot, or anesthetic complication. Surgery typically scheduled 3-4 weeks out. Performed at two locations: one near Pennsylvania parking area, another in a different band location.",

            "description": "Repair means suturing the tissue back together to heal. Excision means removing a portion of the torn meniscus and reshaping the remaining portion to look like a normal meniscus. Doctor is aggressive with repairs when possible because the tissue is valuable for protecting cartilage, especially in younger patients."

It is unclear exactly how much meniscus can be lost before deterioration begins, but it is suspected to be a small amount. This is why surgeons try to remove the least amount necessary."
